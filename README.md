# CelebFaces_Project

# Project Purpose:
The project focuses on loading and processing the CelebA dataset, which contains over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attributes. The task is to classify a specific attribute (e.g., "Smiling") using a custom neural network model. The processing involves resizing images and normalizing pixel values. Data augmentation is used to enhance the diversity of training data, improving the model's generalization on new test data. A pre-trained model like MobileNetV2 is employed as a feature extractor, and custom output layers are added to classify the chosen attribute.

# Data Used
The CelebA dataset, which includes over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations for 40 attributes, is the primary dataset for this project. Images are processed to resize and normalize pixel values.
